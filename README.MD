## About Us
<p>Welcome to MyAdminPanel, a powerful admin dashboard designed to cater to the specific requirements outlined in the Figma file provided by MarbleAI. This refined repository integrates a sleek design with robust functionality to offer an enhanced user experience.</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>

MyAdminPanel leverages the capabilities of daisyUI, a popular framework for crafting user interfaces. daisyUI offers a collection of pre-built components that streamline the development process and ensure a consistent, visually appealing design language. 

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of my approach:

* **Refine Templates:** I utilized Refine's pre-built template to construct the core layout of the admin dashboard. This approach saved development time and guaranteed a modern, responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
* **Dynamic Revenue Graph:** The revenue graph is a dynamic component that reflects daily revenue data. Data is fetched and displayed in a visually compelling manner using daisyUI's charting components.
* **Interactive Range Pickers:** Two strategically placed range pickers empower users to select specific date ranges. The revenue graph automatically updates to reflect the chosen timeframe, providing users with an interactive way to explore their revenue trends.
* **Hover Tooltips:** To enhance user experience and provide additional context, I implemented hover tooltips that surface detailed information when a user hovers over a specific data point on the revenue graph.

<h4>Implementation Decisions</h4>

I made several key decisions throughout the implementation process to ensure the effectiveness and maintainability of MyAdminPanel:

* **Component-Based Architecture:** The dashboard is constructed using a component-based architecture. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and fosters a well-organized codebase.
